## From the Author

This site is perfect for creating a resume or creating a personal page for freelancers: marketers, designers, and so on. The site is easy to modify and can be easily changed if necessary. I would be grateful if you go to the social networks below and subscribe.

## What needs to be done

1. It is necessary to clean the code from unnecessary constructions, make it more compact for further modifications.
2. It is necessary to make competent filling of all pages: describe achievements and add all projects.
3. The contact form is now working on a separate service, you need to do it natively.
4. Add support for multiple languages.
5. Improve US/UI design for better user experience.
